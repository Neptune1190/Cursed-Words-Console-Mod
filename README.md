# Cursed-Words-Console-Mod
exposes the internal Console used by developers on the ` key, also packaged in with modded saves so as to prevent the breaking of vanilla saves

# **Disclaimer**

Neither me (Neptune6866), nor the fine folks at Buried Things/Forklift Interactive take responsibility for what you do with this mod, I will not be fixing saves, or achievements, or anything else you may break with this. Somethings in this mod may not work, break the game, or otherwise ruin your save file.
